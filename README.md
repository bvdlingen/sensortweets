This simple bot is doing two things:

(public graphana instance without image rendering)

2. posting it to twitter

3. The final script is meant to be scheduled using cron or a systemd timer.

requirements:
- nodejs
- npm
- capture-website-cli
- python
Only docker is needed for the alternative script
